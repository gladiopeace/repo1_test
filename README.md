The main classes, functions, and methods that will be used in the code are:

1. Class: FileHandler
   - Method: read_file - To read the contents of a given text file.
   - Method: write_file - To write the given content to a specified file.

2. Function: sanitize_input - To sanitize the input text.

3. Function: convert_to_custom_format - To convert the sanitized text into the custom format.

Now, let's write the Python code for these classes and functions.

File: `file_handler.py`
