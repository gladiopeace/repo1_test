Specification:

Program Name: TextFileConverter

Program Description: 
The TextFileConverter program is designed to read a text file, sanitize the input, and convert it into a custom format. The custom format is defined as each line of the text file being preceded by '  - ' and wrapped in quotes. The program will output the converted text to a new file.

Dependencies:
Python's built-in modules: os, json, and codecs

Core Classes and Functions:

1. Class: FileHandler
   - Purpose: To handle file reading and writing operations.

   - Method: read_file
     - Input: file_path (str)
     - Output: contents (str)
     - Purpose: To read the contents of a given text file. It will throw an exception if the file does not exist or is not accessible.

   - Method: write_file
     - Input: file_path (str), content (str)
     - Output: None
     - Purpose: To write the given content to a specified file. If the file does not exist, it will be created.

2. Function: sanitize_input
   - Input: text (str)
   - Output: sanitized_text (str)
   - Purpose: To sanitize the input text. This function will remove any harmful or unwanted characters from the text.

3. Function: convert_to_custom_format
   - Input: text (str)
   - Output: custom_text (str)
   - Purpose: To convert the sanitized text into the custom format. This function will iterate over each line of the text, prepend '  - ' and wrap the line in quotes.

Program Flow:

1. The program will first read the provided text file using the read_file method of the FileHandler class.
2. The read text is then sanitized using the sanitize_input function.
3. The sanitized text is then converted into the custom format using the convert_to_custom_format function.
4. The converted text is written to a new file using the write_file method of the FileHandler class.

Error Handling:

1. The program should handle any file-related errors, such as the file not existing or not being accessible.
2. The program should also handle any errors that may occur during the sanitization or conversion process.
